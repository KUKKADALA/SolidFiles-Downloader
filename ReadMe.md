# SolidFiles Downloader
This little python script downloads the content from solidfiles. The reason I came up with this is 'SolidFiles using too much Pop Ups'. Just copy and paste the SolidFile's link in this script, and wait till it downloads.There shouldn't be any BUGS, but, if there are, then please write to me at x@psychoticelites.com or open an issue on GitHub.


# POINT TO REMEMBER

This script is written on python 2.7, and hence MIGHT not work on older python versions or even the new one. But, I've included python 2.7 portable file, so you can use that as well.



# Are there any threads for this thing?

None. And I don't plan on making one. Just pull up requests on github or email me (Look At Bottom).


# What do I need to run this thing?

1.) Python 2.7.x

# Python Libraries Required

1.) BeautifulSoup 4.3.2 (Included Within This Script)

2.) requests (Included Within This Script)

3.) urllib3 (Included Within This Script)

4.) tqdm (Included Within This Script)

So, You don't really Need to install or download anything extra.


# How do I do what I have to do? (Simple Guide)

1.) Run this script. duh...

2.) Copy the SoliFile's link and paste in this script.(Link Example:- http://www.solidfiles.com/d/01eae01e20/)

3.) Press Enter and wait.

#NOTE:- I'd recommend running it in a cmd for first time, to see if you're missing anything important.


# Features To Come / Planned Updates
