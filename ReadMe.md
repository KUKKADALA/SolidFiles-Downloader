# SolidFiles Downloader

This is a little python script that downloads the content from SolidFiles.com. This can be integrated in any of your python scripts and it'll return the various parameters for the file present on a particular SolidFiles link.


# Python Support

This is supported by both, Python 2 and 3.

# Windows Binary 

If you're on windows, then you should grab the windows binary from the release section, rather than running python script.

# What do I need to run this thing?

1.) Python 2.7.x or Pythno 3.x.x

# Python Libraries Required

1.) requests

2.) tqdm

You can get these libraries from `pip` or `easy_install` by running the commands. Or you can use the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository to fetch all the dependencies at once.`pip install -r requirements.txt` is the command that should do the job. Make sure you're in the directory where the `requirements.txt` is present.

# How do I do what I have to do? (Simple Guide)

1.) Run this script.

2.) Copy the SoliFile's link and paste in this script.(Link Example:- http://www.solidfiles.com/d/01eae01e20/)

3.) Press Enter and wait.

#NOTE:- I'd recommend running it in a cmd for first time, to see if you're missing anything important.


# Features To Come / Planned Updates

1.) To show how much time is left in completing the file download.


# Update Log :

1.) Re-wrote the whole script with function calls for better work flow.

2.) If the file doesn't exist, the script gives the respective error(s).

3.) Fixed the Slow Download Speed in the script.

4.) Re-wrote the script again to use the classes and remove the junk code. Simple structure now.

5.) Removed `embedURL` entry. Seems like only `.mp4` has that parameter.
